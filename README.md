Famous mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed a simple alternating series to calculate the value of pi. Utilize the Leibniz series in a program that asks the user for how many iterations they would like the program to incorporate the series to calculate the value of pi. The program will display the value of pi after it runs the desired amount of iterations.
